#svideo
React Project for Thinkful - an app that searches through a library of Netflix shows and provides details on them including their official trailer and IMDB rating     

##Introduction
Svideo is an app for those who love their entertainment. A user can conveniently search through 21 titles and decide what they want to binge on next! The app provides the user with initial context about the show including its name, poster and description. Upon selecting a title, the user is then given the show's imdb rating as well as its trailer to help them decide if they are interested.    

##Use Case
Why use this app? Selecting a title to stream can be a frustrating and time-consuming endeavor. Often, the selector will read what a title is about, look at the cast and then check the title's rating on one site and its trailer on another. With this app, a viewer can do all three in one convenient location.       

##UX
The user can search on the landing page or Browse all the selections. Each title is presented in a rectangular box and each one of these can be selected, taking the user to that title's specific page. 

##To use
gh-pages does not like something I'm doing so to run:

* clone or download the repo and run from local machine.
* npm i
* npm run build 
* http-server ./ 
* run on localhost:8080
